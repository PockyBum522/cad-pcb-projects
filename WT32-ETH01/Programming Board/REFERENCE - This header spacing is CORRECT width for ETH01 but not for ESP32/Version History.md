VER: 00.00.01
    * First order from JLCPCB on 2023-06-29 

VER: 00.00.02
    * Updated version screenprint
    * Centered letters in middle, indicating rows. They were not quite aligned vertically with each other or the center
    * Moved R3v3 to be at the end of rail to be consistent with others

To consider:
    * Making 3 columns of A, B, C etc indicators, as that would potentially make it more obvious which pads are *not* connected to MCU pins. This may not be needed once headers are soldered in, it might be obvious
